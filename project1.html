        <h2>Origin of Coffee</h2>
        <div class="origin">
            Coffee is believed to have originated from Ethiopia as the coffee plant grows there naturally. Around 500 –
            800 A.D, the coffee plant was then taken to Yemen by one of the great masters, who was based in the port
            city of Mocha.This coffee invasion was the start of the love affair of the western world, where they began
            setting up coffee houses for the rich, and it also became the centre of intellectual activities.The most
            loved beverage also has beneficial effects. Coffee is naturally rich in antioxidants that can help
            rejuvenate your body and well-being. The Green Coffee is believed to help speed up your metabolism and as an
            aid to weight loss.

            Caffeine is also one of the substances that can be found in these little brown beans, which is the reason
            why loads of people (including me) love it.

            It’s the side effects of coffee that most of us are after to avoid the sleepiness and sluggish feeling
            during daytime or when needed.

                    <strong>Turkish Coffee</strong>
                    <h5 class="content"> Turkish coffee is very finely ground coffee brewed by boiling. Any coffee bean
                        may be used; arabica
                        varieties are considered best, but robusta or a blend is also used.The coffee grounds are left
                        in the coffee when served.Coffee and water, usually with added sugar, is brought to the boil in
                        a special pot called cezve in
                        Turkey, and often called ibrik elsewhere. As soon as the mixture begins to froth, and before it
                        boils over, it is taken off the heat; it may be briefly reheated twice more to increase the
                        desired
                        froth. The coffee is traditionally served in a small porcelain cup called a kahve fincanı
